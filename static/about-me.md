I'm Aliaksei Bialiauski, a hands-on Java developer, Architect, and Open source contributor.
Update: Since July 2022 I'm working as Java developer at [Solvd](https://www.solvd.com/).

I'm an active open-source [contributor](https://github.com/h1alexbel) of few projects,
including [EOLANG](https://github.com/objectionary/eo),
[EO-CQRS](https://github.com/eo-cqrs), [cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos), and others.
Also, I found a [few](/products) projects of mine.

As for now I'm highly interested in R&D projects in the area of Social Program Analysis.
I found a joy for me when designing tools for developers like programming languages,
frameworks, and just reusable components that will imply simplicity,
traceability and productivity.

I'm a big fan of russian food,
[Raf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raf_coffee) coffee,
and good movies, here's
[my list](/to-watch.html) of the ones.
[Here is](/programming-books.html) the list of programming books I recommend you to read.

If you are interested, my [personality type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)
is [INTJ-A](/assets/images/personality.png).
