I'm Aliaksei Bialiauski, a hands-on programmer, architect, and Open source contributor.
Update: Since July 2022 I'm working as Java developer at [Solvd](https://www.solvd.com/).

I'm a programmer. I write mostly in Java, as well as in Python, and JavaScript.
I'm active open source contributor of a few projects
([GitHub](https://github.com/h1alexbel)), and I do [own](/products) my products
too.

As for now I'm highly interested in R&D projects in the area of Social Program Analysis
and Neural Metrics. My next big goal is to get [MSc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science)
in Machine Learning.

What about my personal life? I'm a big fan of russian food,
[coffee filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_filter#V60), and good
movies (check this [list](/to-watch.html)).

If you are interested, my [personality type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)
is [INTJ-A](/assets/images/personality.png).
