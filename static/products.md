I experienced a joy when designing tools for developers like programming
languages, frameworks, and just reusable components that will inject
simplicity, traceability and productivity into our daily work.
This is the list of products I've created and actively using now.

<a href="https://eo-cqrs.github.io/.github"><b>EO-CQRS</b></a> True OOP, small components for clean microservices development.
</p>
Originally, it's a set of useful object-oriented components to make microservices
more maintainable and testable.
Me and other contributors so far made [EO-Kafka](https://eo-cqrs.github.io/eo-kafka),
[eokson](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/eokson), [xfake](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/xfake), [cmig](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/xfake)
and more.
