I experience a joy when designing tools for developers like libraries,
frameworks, and just simple reusable components that will inject simplicity,
traceability and productivity into our daily work. This is the list of products
I've created and actively using or used.

[code-review-action] - GitHub action for checking quality of code reviews
in the pull requests, empowered with LLMs.

[samples-filter] - Command-line filter for dataset of GitHub repositories that
contain "samples", rather than real project, framework, or library.

[reports-check-action] - Bug Reports Quality Checker. The quality of bug
reports is paramount for the overall quality of a software project: poorly
formulated bug reports often lead to wasted time, programmers frustration, and
delays. This repository is a Github Action that would trigger on every new
issue submitted, check that issue for quality problems, and report them in the
issue as a comment, asking bug reporter to fix the report.

<a href="https://eo-cqrs.github.io/.github"><b>EO-CQRS</b></a> True OOP, small components for clean microservices development.
</p>
Originally, it's a set of useful object-oriented components to make microservices
more maintainable and testable.
Me and other contributors so far made [EO-Kafka](https://eo-cqrs.github.io/eo-kafka),
[eokson](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/eokson), [xfake](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/xfake), [cmig](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/xfake)
and more.
