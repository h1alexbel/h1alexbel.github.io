My favorite Software Engineering Books
---

There are plenty of books about software engineering, but only a few of them rank
among
[my favorites](http://astore.amazon.com/yegor256com-20). I read all of those that do over and over again, and I might
just update this post in the future when I stumble upon something else that's decent.

Note that I tried to put the most important books at the top of the list.

[**Java Concurrency in Practice**](http://amzn.to/2cs3KZR) by Brian Goetz et al.
<br>
This is a very practical book about Java multi-threading, and at the same time,
it provides a lot of theoretical knowledge about concurrency in general. I highly
recommend you read it at least once.
