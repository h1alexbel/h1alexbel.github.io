During research of [samples-filter], where we try to detect sample
repositories, that mostly contain educational or demonstration materials
supposed to be copied instead of reused as a dependency, we stuck at the
point of dataset collection. GitHub API [can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37602893/github-search-limit-results)
return only the 1000 results at once. In order to conquer this problem, we
developed [ghminer], a command-line tool that aggregates limitless amount 
of repositories from GitHub, using provided [GitHub PATs].

In order to use `ghminer`, let's install first (you will need [npm] installed):

```bash
npm install -g ghminer
```

Then, execute:

```bash
ghminer --query "stars:2..100000 size:>=20 mirror:false template:false topic:ruby" \
  --start "2019-01-01" \
  --end "2024-05-01" \
  --tokens pats.txt \
  --json
```

Where `stars:2..100000 size:>=20 mirror:false template:false topic:ruby` is
the [search query] to the [GitHub API], `2019-01-01` is a start date to search
the repositories those were created at this date, `2024-05-01` is an end to
search the repositories those were created at this date.
`pats.txt` is a file that contains a number of your [GitHub PATs], separated by
the line break, should look like this:

```text
ghp_pAAAAAA......VCL7wgw
ghp_oBBBBB......XE1ySTKq
```

Depends on the possible captured repositories, the collection process can take
a while. When it's done, you should have both: `result.csv` and `result.json`.

That's it, now you can use it in your researches!

PS. Here is the [example] of collected 14.4k Javascript repositories
(took me ~57min to collect) that were created during 2023-01-01..2024-05-01.
