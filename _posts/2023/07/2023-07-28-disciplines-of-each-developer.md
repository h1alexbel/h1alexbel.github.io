How did you deploy software to production?
Did you use Kubernetes?
No, I'm not a DevOps guy, I'm a Developer!
OK, which documents you produce and activities in which you participate
as a software developer besides coding?
I'm just writing code, I'm a Developer.
I'm here a lot these days.
And it's a very wrong attitude.
Here, in this blog post, I'm saying what you
need to know and regularly practice as a software developer 
to become a ~~CTO~~ self-capable unit of work.

I strongly believe that being a developer, besides coding, you need to know
how to help you project.
Remember, when coders create lines of code,
professional developers create software that works.

## Business Modelling

## Requirements

SRS, Use-cases

## Design

UML, SAD, docs

## Implementation

Declarative programming, reusability

## Test

Unit, Integration, e2e, Load, Performance testing

## Deployment

AWS, Kubernetes, Docker

## Configuration Management

VCS, Terraform, Pipelines

## Project Management

PMBOK, RUP

You need to go full cycle.
The best way to do it is to create your own [pet]() project.
There, you will practice all the disciplines, 
and you will be able to do them in a large-scale project.
