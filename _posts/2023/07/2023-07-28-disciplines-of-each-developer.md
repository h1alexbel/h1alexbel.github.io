How did you deploy software to production?
Did you use Kubernetes?
No, I'm not a DevOps guy, I'm a Developer!
OK, which documents you produce and activities in which you participate
as a software developer besides coding?
I'm just writing code, I'm a Developer.
I'm here a lot these days.
And it's a very wrong attitude.
Here, in this blog post, I'm saying what you
need to know and regularly practice as a software developer 
to become a ~~CTO~~ self-capable unit of work.

I strongly believe that being a developer, besides coding, you need to know
how to help you project.
Remember, when coders create lines of code,
professional developers create software that works.

What are the steps to build from zero some more or less
stable software product?

According to [RUP](), there are 9 disciplines
in a common software project:
* Business Modeling
* Requirements
* Analysis & Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Configuration & Change Management
* Project Management
* Environment

All of them you need to be aware of!

And don't get me wrong.
You need to be a niche specialist, a niche-focused **expert**.
Imagine X & Y coords, on X is your disciplines,
while on Y is your tech stack you're expert in.
**If you are a niche-focused expert,
and at the same time, know all activities in software project,
you will the MVP on each project**.

## Business Modelling

## Requirements

SRS, Use-cases

## Design

UML, SAD, docs

## Implementation

Declarative programming, reusability

## Test

Unit, Integration, e2e, Load, Performance testing

## Deployment

AWS, Kubernetes, Docker

## Configuration Management

VCS, Terraform, Pipelines

## Project Management

PMBOK, RUP

You need to go full cycle.
The best way to do it is to create your own [pet]() project.
There, you will practice all the disciplines, 
and you will be able to do them in a large-scale project.
