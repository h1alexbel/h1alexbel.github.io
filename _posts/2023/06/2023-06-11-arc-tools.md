To be a great software architect or developer, you definitely need to use your daily tools properly.
But what are they?
Which tools the successful architect should be masterly on.
Also, it will help
to understand the activities of architect doing
in [well organized](https://h1alexbel.github.io/2023/01/21/maintainable-project-template.html) software project.

## Tickets

Tickets is your tool number one.
To say the least, It's even tool number one for each **serious** developer.
As an architect, you must decompose tasks into tickets.
They must be small enough (not more than 2 hours, I believe).

## SRS

Software Requirements Specification, or just a requirements, that your customer sends to you.
You must create and maintain **well-designed** document including all the specs.
And this is not easy.
You should know all the rules, what to include, what to skip, etc.
It must be **simple**, and understood by all the people connected to project.
Read [_10 Typical Mistakes in Specs_](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html) by [@yegor256](https://github.com/yegor256).

## Diagrams

Explaining your thoughts and ideas to your team is what architect does in his routine.
But text explanation is not the best tool when it comes to design or architecture.
Here it comes to some modeling language, with standards, of course.
The best one - Unified Modeling Language, or **UML**, for short.
Thus, instead of writing the poems on "How our system actually works",
you will send a simple, properly organized, according to all standards, diagram to your developers.

Again, it must be simple.
And I think that complexity is a key factor of a bad developer;
I'm not even talking about the architect.

The best sources for learning UML, again the books!

Also, you should be aware of existing of [**Model Driven Architecture**](https://www.omg.org/mda) (MDA).

This video will help you:

Needless to say, good tools for modeling ar [**Visual Paradigm**](https://online.visual-paradigm.com) and [**PlantUML**](https://plantuml.com).
Despite UML having a quite large list of standards, you will probably use only few diagrams.

And the last one here.
Please don't use colors or any other attractive design elements.
We are making those diagrams in order to be understood by others, not to impress people.
