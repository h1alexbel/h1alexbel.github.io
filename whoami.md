I'm Aliaksei Bialiauski (Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Алексей Беля́вский</span>),
an Integration Developer, Architect, Open Source enthusiast.

Update: Since July 2022 I'm working as Integration/Java Developer
at [Solvd](https://www.solvd.com/).

I am a software developer and architect with a strong background in
backend/integration systems, and object-oriented analysis and design with Java.
<br>
Tech stack mostly I work with: Java, Spring Boot for backend,
PostgreSQL for DB, Kubernetes/Terraform/Helm for ops,
AWS/GCP for cloud stuff, and a little bit of TypeScript.
<br>
Now I'm interested in R&D projects in the area of
Programming Languages and related Software Development platforms.

I am a big open-source fan, I found a [few](/pets/),
including [EO-CQRS](https://eo-cqrs.github.io/.github)
and [actively contribute](https://github.com/h1alexbel)
to [Blamer](https://blamer-io.github.io/blamer),
[cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos)
and others.

Also, I'm making some videos about Software Design, OOAD, and Software Development in general.
Check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@absimplearchitect/featured).

Here are [my favorite books](/best-books/)
about software engineering.

If you are interested, my [personality type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)
is [INTJ-A](/assets/images/personality.png).

Ah, one more thing. I'm a big fan of Russian food,
